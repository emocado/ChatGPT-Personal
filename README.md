## Credits to [Javascript Mastery Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FeymQoKvrk)

## Main take away from this project:
1. How different parameters of OpenAI's model affect the output
2. How to deploy server/backend on [Render](https://render.com/) now that Heroku is no longer free
3. Trying out Vercel instead of Netlify for frontend
